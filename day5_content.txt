Binary tree:
    A node can have maximum two childrens


Binary tree Traversal:
Types : 1.In_order     ----> left-root-right  --->(LDR)
        2.Pre_order    ----> root-left-right  --->(DLR) 
        2.Post_order   ----> left-right-root  --->(LRD)
       where L = left
             D = data
             R = right

Types of Binary Tree:
           ----->  1.Full Binary Tree :
                         -->All the nodes have 0 or 2 children
                   2.Degenerate or Pathological Tree :
                         --> Every node will have 0 or 1 children
                   3.Skewed Binary Tree :
                         --> Tree exists in only in one direction
                       i.Left Skewed : exists only on left side
                       ii.Right Skewed : exists only on right side
                   4.Complete Binary Tree :            
                      i.Every levle should be full or complete
                      ii.In last level if it is incomplete , nodes should be present at extreme left side
                   5.Perfect Binary Tree :
                         --> All internal nodes which has two children and leaf nodes should be at same level
                   
                   6.Balanced Binary tree :
                         --> For all the nodes height of left sub tree - height of right sub tree can be 0 or 1 then it is called as balanced tree
                   7.Binary Search Tree :
                         --> All the left side elements should be lesser than its parent
                         --> All the right side elements should be greater than its parent
