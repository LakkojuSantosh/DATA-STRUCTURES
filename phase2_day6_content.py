Graphs:
   ---> It is a Non-linear data structure
   
Adjacency : Connection should be there must be a route or path
 
Types of Graphs:-
        1.Undirected graphs
        2.Directed graphs
        3.Weigh graphs

          |  \       | \
          |    \     | (4)
          |      \   | /
          |         \|/
         (2)------- (3)





Representation of Graphs:
    1.List of edges
    2.Adjacency List
    3.Adjacency Matrix

***BFS & DFS :
In Breadth First Search, visit and then move on to all the vertices 
whereas ,in DFS after visitindg a node select on adjacent vertex and exlore it completely move on with other vertex


*****Dijkstra algorithm:
   1. It comes under greedy method where solution for the given problem will be figured out stage by stage.
   2. Dijkstra algorithm helps to find out the shortest path or distance from one vertex to all the other vertices.

 -----> Drawback:
         If weight of any edge is a negative number,dijkstra won't work for that.
